 Introduction


The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was
expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and
twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire
burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the
lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our
glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather
than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious
after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the
trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this wayâ€”marking the
points with a lean forefingerâ€”as we sat and lazily admired his
earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.

â€œYou must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two
ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,
they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.â€

â€œIs not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?â€ said
Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.

â€œI do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground
for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of
course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real
existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.
These things are mere abstractions.â€

â€œThat is all right,â€ said the Psychologist.

â€œNor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a
real existence.â€

â€œThere I object,â€ said Filby. â€œOf course a solid body may exist. All
real thingsâ€”â€

â€œSo most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube
exist?â€

â€œDonâ€™t follow you,â€ said Filby.

â€œCan a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real
existence?â€

Filby became pensive. â€œClearly,â€ the Time Traveller proceeded, â€œany
real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have
Length, Breadth, Thickness, andâ€”Duration. But through a natural
infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we
incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three
which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,
however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former
three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our
consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter
from the beginning to the end of our lives.â€

â€œThat,â€ said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his
cigar over the lamp; â€œthat . . . very clear indeed.â€

â€œNow, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,â€
continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness.
â€œReally this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some
people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It
is only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between
Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our
consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish people have got hold of
the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say
about this Fourth Dimension?â€

â€œ_I_ have not,â€ said the Provincial Mayor.

â€œIt is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is
spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,
Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three
planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical
people have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularlyâ€”why not
another direction at right angles to the other three?â€”and have even
tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb
was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month
or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two
dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and
similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could
represent one of fourâ€”if they could master the perspective of the
thing. See?â€

â€œI think so,â€ murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,
he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who
repeats mystic words. â€œYes, I think I see it now,â€ he said after some
time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.

â€œWell, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry
of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For
instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at
fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All
these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional
representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and
unalterable thing.

â€œScientific people,â€ proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause
required for the proper assimilation of this, â€œknow very well that Time
is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a
weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of
the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then
this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the
mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space
generally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that
line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.â€

â€œBut,â€ said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, â€œif
Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has
it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move
in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?â€

The Time Traveller smiled. â€œAre you so sure we can move freely in
Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,
and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions.
But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.â€

â€œNot exactly,â€ said the Medical Man. â€œThere are balloons.â€

â€œBut before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the
inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.â€

â€œStill they could move a little up and down,â€ said the Medical Man.

â€œEasier, far easier down than up.â€

â€œAnd you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the
present moment.â€

â€œMy dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the
whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present
moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no
dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform
velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_
if we began our existence fifty miles above the earthâ€™s surface.â€

â€œBut the great difficulty is this,â€ interrupted the Psychologist. â€™You
_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about
in Time.â€

â€œThat is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that
we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an
incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I
become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course
we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than
a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a
civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go
up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that
ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the
Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?â€

â€œOh, _this_,â€ began Filby, â€œis allâ€”â€

â€œWhy not?â€ said the Time Traveller.

â€œItâ€™s against reason,â€ said Filby.

â€œWhat reason?â€ said the Time Traveller.

â€œYou can show black is white by argument,â€ said Filby, â€œbut you will
never convince me.â€

â€œPossibly not,â€ said the Time Traveller. â€œBut now you begin to see the
object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long
ago I had a vague inkling of a machineâ€”â€

â€œTo travel through Time!â€ exclaimed the Very Young Man.

â€œThat shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as
the driver determines.â€

Filby contented himself with laughter.

â€œBut I have experimental verification,â€ said the Time Traveller.

â€œIt would be remarkably convenient for the historian,â€ the Psychologist
suggested. â€œOne might travel back and verify the accepted account of
the Battle of Hastings, for instance!â€

â€œDonâ€™t you think you would attract attention?â€ said the Medical Man.
â€œOur ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.â€

â€œOne might get oneâ€™s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,â€ the
Very Young Man thought.

â€œIn which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The
German scholars have improved Greek so much.â€

â€œThen there is the future,â€ said the Very Young Man. â€œJust think! One
might invest all oneâ€™s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and
hurry on ahead!â€

â€œTo discover a society,â€ said I, â€œerected on a strictly communistic
basis.â€

â€œOf all the wild extravagant theories!â€ began the Psychologist.

â€œYes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it untilâ€”â€

â€œExperimental verification!â€ cried I. â€œYou are going to verify _that_?â€

â€œThe experiment!â€ cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.

â€œLetâ€™s see your experiment anyhow,â€ said the Psychologist, â€œthough itâ€™s
all humbug, you know.â€

The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and
with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of
the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to
his laboratory.

The Psychologist looked at us. â€œI wonder what heâ€™s got?â€

â€œSome sleight-of-hand trick or other,â€ said the Medical Man, and Filby
tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he
had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filbyâ€™s
anecdote collapsed.




 II.
 The Machine


The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic
framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately
made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline
substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that followsâ€”unless his
explanation is to be acceptedâ€”is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He
took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the
room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug.
On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat
down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the
bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a
dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and
several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat
in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to
be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat
behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the
Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the
Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the
Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me
that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly
done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.

The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. â€œWell?â€
said the Psychologist.

â€œThis little affair,â€ said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon
the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, â€œis only
a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will
notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd
twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way
unreal.â€ He pointed to the part with his finger. â€œAlso, here is one
little white lever, and here is another.â€

The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.
â€œItâ€™s beautifully made,â€ he said.

â€œIt took two years to make,â€ retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we
had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: â€œNow I want
you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends
the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the
motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently
I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will
vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the
thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no
trickery. I donâ€™t want to waste this model, and then be told Iâ€™m a
quack.â€

There was a minuteâ€™s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to
speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth
his finger towards the lever. â€œNo,â€ he said suddenly. â€œLend me your
hand.â€ And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individualâ€™s hand
in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the
Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its
interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain
there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame
jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little
machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost
for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory;
and it was goneâ€”vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.

Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.

The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under
the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. â€œWell?â€ he
said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he
went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to
fill his pipe.

We stared at each other. â€œLook here,â€ said the Medical Man, â€œare you in
earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has
travelled into time?â€

â€œCertainly,â€ said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the
fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologistâ€™s
face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped
himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) â€œWhat is more, I have
a big machine nearly finished in thereâ€â€”he indicated the
laboratoryâ€”â€œand when that is put together I mean to have a journey on
my own account.â€

â€œYou mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?â€ said
Filby.

â€œInto the future or the pastâ€”I donâ€™t, for certain, know which.â€

After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. â€œIt must have
gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,â€ he said.

â€œWhy?â€ said the Time Traveller.

â€œBecause I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled
into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must
have travelled through this time.â€

â€œBut,â€ said I, â€œIf it travelled into the past it would have been
visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we
were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!â€

â€œSerious objections,â€ remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of
impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.

â€œNot a bit,â€ said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: â€œYou
think. _You_ can explain that. Itâ€™s presentation below the threshold,
you know, diluted presentation.â€

â€œOf course,â€ said the Psychologist, and reassured us. â€œThatâ€™s a simple
point of psychology. I should have thought of it. Itâ€™s plain enough,
and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we
appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel
spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling
through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it
gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it
creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it
would make if it were not travelling in time. Thatâ€™s plain enough.â€ He
passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. â€œYou
see?â€ he said, laughing.

We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time
Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.

â€œIt sounds plausible enough tonight,â€ said the Medical Man; â€œbut wait
until tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.â€

â€œWould you like to see the Time Machine itself?â€ asked the Time
Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way
down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly
the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of
the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how
there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little
mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of
nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of
rock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted
crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of
drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed
to be.

â€œLook here,â€ said the Medical Man, â€œare you perfectly serious? Or is
this a trickâ€”like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?â€

â€œUpon that machine,â€ said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft,
â€œI intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in
my life.â€

None of us quite knew how to take it.

I caught Filbyâ€™s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he
winked at me solemnly.
