This page is for our smaller shipping methods where you can order a couple of crates for a pooled shipment which is ideal for when you need a shipment but don't have a lot to ship. Try and keep the amount of crates ordered per shipment below 50 as that will constitute the shipment being more along the lines of being a large shipment
